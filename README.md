# talk-to-me
A simple HTTP and socket server library built in TypeScript + Node.js.

The primary goal of this library is to provide a framework that facilitates a clear and error-free communication
structure between the server and client: every message that is sent needs to have a corresponding message handler on the
other side, all messages should have a well-defined format, etc.  With that said, this library lends itself very well
to building HTTP and/or socket APIs.
