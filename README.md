# talk-to-me
A simple HTTP and socket server library built for TypeScript on Node.js.

The primary goal of this library is to provide a framework that facilitates the design of a clear and error-free
communication structure between the server and client:
* every message that is sent needs to have a corresponding message handler on the other side
* all messages should have a well-defined format
* At no point should the programmer be able to mistakenly send the wrong arguments because they misread the docs

All of these things are guaranteed by the clever typing system.
